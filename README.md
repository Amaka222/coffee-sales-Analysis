## Introduction/Overview
Project Overview/Introduction
Introduction
In this project, we analyze a dataset containing transaction records from a coffee shop chain operating in more than two locations: Lower Manhattan, Hell's Kitchen and Astoria. The dataset provides detailed information about each transaction, including transaction ID, date, time, quantity purchased, store details, product information, unit price, and revenue generated. Our objective is to gain insights into customer behavior, popular products, and revenue trends across different locations and times.

The objective of analyzing this dataset is to derive actionable insights and strategic recommendations for the coffee shop chain based on transactional data. Specifically, the analysis aims to:
1.	Understand Customer Behavior: Investigate which products are most popular among customers, both in terms of quantity sold and revenue generated, to optimize inventory and marketing efforts.
2.	Identify Sales Trends: Determine peak sales hours, days, and months to improve staffing schedules and resource allocation across different store locations.
3.	Enhance Product Offering: Analyze the performance of different product categories (e.g., coffee, tea, bakery) and variants (e.g., sizes, flavors) to refine the product mix and introduce new offerings based on customer preferences.
4.	Optimize Revenue Generation: Calculate and compare revenue generated from various products and store locations to identify opportunities for maximizing profitability.
5.	Inform Business Strategy: Provide insights that support strategic decision-making, such as pricing adjustments, promotional activities, and expansion plans, tailored to each store location and product category.

## Dataset Summary

The dataset comprises transactions recorded on January 1st to June 2023, spanning three locations:

•	Lower Manhattan: Transactions occurred throughout the day, starting from 7:06 AM to 7:59 AM, with a diverse range of products including coffee, tea, drinking chocolate, and bakery items.

## Key Points of Analysis

1.	Product Categories: The dataset includes products categorized into coffee, tea, drinking chocolate, and bakery items, each with specific types and sizes.
2.	Sales Distribution: Lower Manhattan exhibits a broader range of products and higher transaction volumes compared to Hell's Kitchen, indicating potentially higher customer traffic or a larger product selection.
3.	Time Analysis: Transactions are recorded hourly, allowing for analysis of peak sales hours and product popularity during specific times of the day.
4.	Revenue Insights: Calculating revenue from unit prices and quantities provides insights into the financial performance of different product categories and store locations.

## Findings
1. According to the data given, we have a total transaction of  about 149456 and all transations are from January to June 2023. there coffee shops are located in three rejions which are Lower manhattan, Heells Kitchen and Astoria.
